# GridHub Smart Contracts

This directory contains the smart contracts powering GridHub's decentralized collaboration platform built on LUKSO blockchain technology.

## Technology Stack

GridHub smart contracts leverage LUKSO's innovative blockchain infrastructure and standards:

- **Universal Profiles (UP)**: Digital identity standard (LSP0) that serves as the foundation for user and project identities
- **LSP7 Digital Asset**: Used for implementing reputation tokens and project-specific tokens
- **LSP8 Identifiable Digital Asset**: For unique assets like achievement badges and credentials
- **LSP9 Vaults**: For secure management of project funds and resources
- **LSP12 Issued Assets**: For tracking relationships between projects and their issued tokens
- **LSP17 Contract Extension**: For enhancing Universal Profiles with platform-specific functionality

## Contract Architecture

### Core Identity Contracts

- **ProfileManager**: Extensions for Universal Profiles that enable GridHub-specific functionalities
- **ReputationRegistry**: Tracks and manages user reputation across the platform
- **CredentialVerifier**: Verifies and stores user credentials and achievements

### Collaboration Contracts

- **ProjectHub**: Central contract for creating and managing collaborative projects
- **TaskManager**: Handles task creation, assignment, completion verification, and rewards
- **ResourceAllocation**: Manages project resources and how they're distributed
- **GovernanceModules**: Customizable governance models for collaborative decision-making

### Financial Contracts

- **RevenueDistributor**: Automates profit-sharing among project contributors
- **TokenizationEngine**: Allows projects to create and manage their own tokens
- **FundingPool**: Manages fundraising and budget allocation for projects

## Smart Contract Interactions

GridHub's smart contracts interact with LUKSO's standards in the following ways:

1. **Universal Profiles as Digital Identities**:
   - Users interact with the platform through their Universal Profiles
   - Projects can have their own Universal Profiles for improved management
   - Reputation and credentials are attached to Universal Profiles

2. **LSP7 & LSP8 for Tokenization**:
   - Project tokens utilize LSP7 for fungible assets
   - Unique rewards, credentials, and achievements use LSP8
   - Smart voting rights can be implemented using these token standards

3. **LSP9 Vaults for Treasury Management**:
   - Each project can have its own vault for fund management
   - Multi-signature controls for collective fund governance
   - Programmable distribution of project revenues

## Development Process

Our smart contracts follow a rigorous development process:

1. Design and architecture planning
2. Implementation in Solidity 
3. Comprehensive testing with Hardhat
4. Security audit preparations
5. Deployment to LUKSO testnet and then mainnet

## Getting Started with Development

To work with these smart contracts:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to LUKSO testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network l16
```

## Security Considerations

Our contracts implement several security features:

- Reentrancy guards for all external calls
- Access control mechanisms for sensitive operations
- Integer overflow/underflow protection
- Event emissions for off-chain monitoring
- Emergency pause functionality for critical issues

## Future Development

Planned additions to our smart contract ecosystem:

- Dispute resolution mechanisms
- Enhanced reputation algorithms
- Cross-chain collaboration tools
- AI-assisted task allocation integrations

By integrating deeply with LUKSO's Universal Profile ecosystem, GridHub's smart contracts create a seamless, secure platform for decentralized collaboration where digital identity, reputation, and value creation work together harmoniously.
