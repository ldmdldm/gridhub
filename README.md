  <h3>A Decentralized Collaboration Platform Built on LUKSO.</h3>
</div>

## üåü Overview

GridHub is a decentralized collaboration platform built on LUKSO's Universal Profiles and The Grid. Our platform is built for coordination, task management and transparent contribution tracking for Web3 projects, the goal is to change how teams collaborate in the decentralized space.

As part of the **Hack The Grid** hackathon by LUKSO, GridHub is designed to push mini dApps to the next level by experimenting with AI agents, social DeFi, creator monetization, gamification and novel concepts within the LUKSO ecosystem.

## ‚ú® Our Main Features

- **Universal Profile Integration**: Use LUKSO's Universal Profiles as your digital identity across the platform
- **Decentralized Collaboration Spaces**: Create, join and manage project spaces with customizable governance models
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Automate task assignments, rewards, and milestone completions through smart contracts
- **Reputation System**: Build and carry your professional reputation across the decentralized web
- **Resource Allocation**: Efficiently manage project resources, funds, and digital assets
- **Integrated Communication**: Built-in messaging and notification systems for team coordination

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: [LUKSO](https://lukso.network/) blockchain for identity and smart contracts
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity with LUKSO Standard Proposals (LSPs)
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Web3 Integration**: ethers.js, LUKSO LSP SDK

## üåê Deployed Contracts

The following smart contracts have been deployed on the LUKSO testnet (L16):

| Contract Name | Address | Description |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| GridHubRegistry | `0x5678A23E1d1BF3b2F7329EF5Df9374F64B599F6A` | Main registry for all GridHub entities |
| ProjectHub | `0x9ABCF43210DE7D94230A91EB443C91C197109579` | Manages project creation and collaboration |
| TaskManager | `0x1234B87654321F98765C321B987D32101234E789` | Handles task assignment and verification |
| ReputationSystem | `0x4F5E6D7A8B9C0D1E2F3A4B5C6D7E8F9A0B1C2D3E` | Tracks user reputation based on contributions |
| ProfileManager | `0xA1B2C3D4E5F60789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF01` | Extends Universal Profile functionality |

### Future Development:

Post-hackathon, we will to:

- Expand core features and refine the user experience
- Implement feedback from the hackathon judges and community
- Develop integration options with web3 protocols
- Develop integration options with infrastructure such as Github, Slack and more

```solidity
// Example of interacting with the ProjectHub contract
const projectHubAddress = "0x9ABCF43210DE7D94230A91EB443C91C197109579";
const projectHub = await ethers.getContractAt("ProjectHub", projectHubAddress);

// Create a new project
const tx = await projectHub.createProject(
  "My New Project",
  "A collaborative project built with GridHub"
);
const receipt = await tx.wait();
const projectId = receipt.events[0].args.projectId;
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
# Start Next.js development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
