## üèÜ Hack The Grid Hackathon

GridHub was conceived and developed during the "Hack The Grid" hackathon organized by LUKSO. The hackathon focused on creating innovative applications leveraging LUKSO's blockchain infrastructure and Universal Profiles.

### Our Hackathon Journey:

- **Challenge**: To create a solution that transforms collaboration in web3
- **Approach**: We identified key pain points in decentralized project management and designed GridHub to address these challenges while leveraging LUKSO's unique features
- **Development**: Our team worked intensively over the hackathon period to build a functional prototype
- **Presentation**: We showcased GridHub's potential to revolutionize how teams work together in the decentralized ecosystem

### Future Development:

Post-hackathon, we aim to:

- Expand core features and refine the user experience
- Implement feedback from the hackathon judges and community
- Develop additional integration options with other web3 protocols
- Build a sustainable roadmap for long-term development
